# AI Safety Models Proof of Concept - Technical Report

## Executive Summary

This Proof of Concept demonstrates a comprehensive suite of AI safety models for conversational platforms, addressing four critical safety requirements: abuse language detection, escalation pattern recognition, crisis intervention, and content filtering. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer models combined with traditional machine learning and rule-based approaches to provide robust, real-time safety monitoring.

## 1. High-Level Design Decisions

### 1.1 Modular Architecture
The system employs a modular design where each safety component operates independently while sharing common preprocessing and integration layers. This architecture enables:

- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on individual models without system-wide dependencies
- **Flexible Deployment**: Components can be deployed separately based on platform requirements
- **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional even if individual modules fail
- **Easy Extension**: New safety models can be integrated with minimal changes

### 1.2 Multi-Layered Fallback System
To ensure reliability, we implemented a cascading detection approach:
Primary: Transformer Models (BERT-based)
↓ (On failure)
Secondary: Machine Learning Models (TF-IDF + Features)
↓ (On failure)
Tertiary: Rule-based Pattern Matching
↓ (Final fallback)
Context-aware Heuristics
